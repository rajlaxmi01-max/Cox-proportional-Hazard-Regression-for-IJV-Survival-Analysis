Thesis: Effect of number of partners on International Joint Ventures survival: the moderating role of environmental dynamism & technology transfer

Description: 
The study challenges traditional views on the negative impact of increasing partner numbers in IJVs, demonstrating that leveraging diverse resources and dynamic capabilities can enhance performance, particularly in complex environments with technology transfer. 
Utilising a Cox logistic regression model for survival analysis, the research rigorously cleansed, normalised, and analysed data from 669 U.S. IJVs over 24 years, ensuring robust statistical insights.
